# Serialize-and-Deserialize-Binary-Tree
Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree.

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.



CONSTRAINTS:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].

-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
